# Pseudo-Contact

### About

The main goal of this android app is to allow the uer to save the contact of an individual without it having to show up in other apps like WhatsApp etc.

### Why?

Well a lot of people have to save some contacts just for the sake of having them on their contacts list. However, apps like WhasApp read your phone's contact list and now all of these contacts are a part of your WhatsApp feed and while WhatsApp provides some provisions to restrict who gets to view your photo, status etc, it is still a chore to manually exclude them.

Pseudo contact not only allows you to save the contacts that you might need but also make WhatsApp calss, text etc without the specific contact being included in your Phone and other app's lists.
